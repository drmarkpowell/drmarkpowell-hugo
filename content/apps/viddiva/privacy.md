# Vid Diva Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Vid Diva’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## iCloud
Vid Diva stores some of your data in Apple’s iCloud service, such as subscribed TV series and movies, to enable some sync features between all devices signed into your Apple ID.

## RevenueCat for purchases
Vid Diva uses RevenueCat to anonymously manage subscription and in-app purchases. An anonymous user id is generated and used for these purchases and no other purpose. RevenueCat doesn't track any personal information related to you or your watching habits.

## Security
All network data transfers in the Vid Diva app use HTTPS  to keep your information and use of the app secure.

## Third-party links and content
Vid Diva displays links and content  such as episode images and descriptions from third-party television series and movie feeds and sites, and downloads  directly from third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent. (We collect no personal information anyway!)

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers
Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent
By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us
If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email me. Please note that data management should be done within the Vid Diva app, not via email requests, for security reasons.

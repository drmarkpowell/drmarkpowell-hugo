# DJ Mood Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on DJ Mood's apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and any other devices and platforms.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

DJ Mood operates entirely on your device and does not collect any information about you or your usage of the app. We do not:

- Collect personal information
- Track your activity
- Store your data on our servers
- Share your information with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services

## Apple Music Integration

DJ Mood requires access to Apple Music to play playlists. This permission is handled entirely by Apple through MusicKit:

- Your Apple Music authorization is managed by Apple, not by DJ Mood
- Playlist searches and playback are performed using Apple's MusicKit framework
- We do not have access to your Apple Music library data beyond what is necessary to play the playlists you select
- No information about your listening history or preferences is collected or stored by DJ Mood

## Tip Jar

DJ Mood offers an optional tip jar for users who wish to support the app's development. All tip jar transactions are processed securely by Apple through the App Store:

- We do not collect or store your payment information
- All purchases are handled by Apple's secure payment system
- We only receive confirmation that a tip was made, not your financial details

## App Intents and Shortcuts

DJ Mood supports Siri, Spotlight, and Shortcuts integration. These features:

- Are processed locally on your device
- Do not send data to our servers
- Follow Apple's privacy standards for App Intents

## Security

All network data transfers in the DJ Mood app use HTTPS to keep your information and use of the app secure.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent. (We collect no personal information anyway!)

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. Since DJ Mood does not collect any data at all, the app is safe for users of all ages who have access to Apple Music.

## Information for European Union Customers

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Rights

Since DJ Mood does not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. You maintain complete privacy while using the app.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us through the App Store or via the MacStories Discord community.
